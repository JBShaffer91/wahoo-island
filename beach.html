    <li><strong>Tim's Surf Lessons</strong> are the way to go if you don't want to leave without catching your first wave. Tim has five additional instructors, ensuring that each person gets plenty of instruction throughout their sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sky High Helecopter Tours</strong> are a fantastic way to see the island from a bird's eye view. Staring from the South shore, you'll work your way around the coastline to the East side of the island, then you'll be swept across 72,491 acres of dense forest.</li>
